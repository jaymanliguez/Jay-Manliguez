      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Jay Manliguez, an incoming third-year student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Cavite State University ‚Äì Main Campus. I‚Äôve always had a passion for technology ‚Äî not just for how it works, but for how it can create change, tell stories, and connect people. I‚Äôm excited to keep growing in this field and to eventually use what I learn to make meaningful impact in both tech and community spaces. <br><br>
        As a loud and proud transgender woman, I carry my identity with pride and purpose. I believe that living authentically opens the door for others to do the same, and I strive to be that kind of presence ‚Äî bold, visible, and grounded. I also serve as an SK official in our barangay, where I focus on youth empowerment and inclusive leadership. This experience has deepened my sense of responsibility and commitment to giving back.<br><br>
        Beyond academics and leadership, I place deep value on my spirituality, which gives me strength, clarity, and a sense of direction especially in times of uncertainty. My family has always been my foundation ‚Äî their love and support remind me who I am and where I come from. I also cherish my friendships, which bring me joy, growth, and the kind of laughter that makes life feel lighter.<br><br>
        I believe that life is not just about achievement, but also about connection. I hope to continue building a future where tech meets heart ‚Äî one that‚Äôs inclusive, human-centered, and led with integrity.<br></p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Life is full of little joys, and for me, those joys come from the simple things I love doing every day. I enjoy reading stories on Wattpad, where I get lost in different worlds and characters. Watching vlogs is also one of my favorite ways to relax, especially when I want to learn something new or just enjoy someone else‚Äôs perspective. <br><br>
         Like many, I spend time scrolling through Facebook to catch up with what's happening around me, whether it's news, funny posts, or updates from friends. I absolutely love eating street food ‚Äî there's something comforting about the flavors and the atmosphere that comes with it.<br><br>
         I also enjoy watching TV shows, especially those that make me laugh or keep me hooked with interesting plots. Music plays a big part in my life too, and nothing beats the feeling of listening to Taylor Swift songs, which always seem to say exactly what I feel.<br><br>
         Cleaning our house is oddly satisfying and gives me a sense of peace, while taking afternoon naps helps me recharge and feel refreshed. I‚Äôm a natural daydreamer ‚Äî I often catch myself imagining stories or future moments. And of course, spending time with friends and going out every now and then is something I truly cherish.<br><br>
         These hobbies may seem simple, but they make my life meaningful and balanced.<br></p>

      <h3>"Life as a Transgender Student" üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è</h3><br>
      <p>Being a transgender student is a journey filled with self-discovery, strength, and quiet battles that not everyone sees. Every day, I wake up choosing to be true to myself‚Äînot just in how I live, but in how I show up in school, in friendships, and in life.<br><br>
         As a college student, I carry the same pressures many others do: exams, deadlines, sleepless nights. But on top of that, I also carry the weight of navigating life as a transgender‚Äîwhere even small things like being called the right name or using the right restroom can become emotional hurdles. Despite that, I remain focused and dedicated to my studies, always trying to make my future brighter.<br><br>
         One of the hardest parts of this journey is the cost of maintaining my hormone therapy. Taking pills or hormones regularly isn‚Äôt cheap, and as someone who still doesn‚Äôt have a job and depends entirely on my parents, it‚Äôs a burden I constantly worry about. There are times when I have to choose between buying what I need to feel aligned with myself or holding off because I know my family already has so many expenses. It‚Äôs a quiet kind of sacrifice‚Äîone I make not out of weakness, but out of love and understanding.<br><br>
         Being transgender is not just about identity‚Äîit's also about endurance. Sometimes it means waiting, being patient, or making do with less. But through it all, I‚Äôve learned how strong I really am. And even if there are days when I feel behind or tired, I remind myself that my journey is valid, and that every small step forward is still progress.<br><br>
         What gives me hope are the people who support me: friends who listen, teachers who respect me, and moments when I feel seen for who I truly am. I may not have everything figured out yet, but I have a voice, I have dreams, and I have the courage to keep going.<br><br>
         To anyone who reads this and feels the same way‚Äîplease know you‚Äôre not alone. Being yourself in a world that doesn‚Äôt always understand is already an act of bravery. And while there are sacrifices, there is also beauty, growth, and purpose in the journey.<br></p>
